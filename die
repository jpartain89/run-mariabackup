We couldn't find the run-mariabackup.conf configuration file that we require to run!
The file is looked for at:

    /etc/run-mariabackup.conf
            - or -
    /etc/run-mariabackup/run-mariabackup.conf
            - or -
    ~/.config/run-mariabackup.conf

This repo has a configuration file example that you can key off of for what you need to fill out.

Exiting now.
